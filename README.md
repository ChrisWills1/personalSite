# personalSite
This is a personal website showcasing some of my projects

Created a simple website to showcase my projects, this is a work in progress which will be added to over time to include the projects
as they are developed. This was used as a way to introduce myself to version control and using Git and Github.

This is hosted on github.io at the following link: https://chriswills1.github.io/personalSite/

Requirements: 
- Show my name
- have links to relevant social media including twitter and Instagram.
- Have an about me section.
